        "opening": "Six months ago, Serena was hospitalized after a severe panic attack during her A-levels. Today, she sits in the same exam hall, but everything is different. The butterflies in her stomach feel manageable, almost familiar friends.",
        "development": [
            "The rock bottom moment came when Serena collapsed during a math paper, hyperventilating so severely that an ambulance was called. In the hospital, she finally admitted to her parents: 'I can't handle this anymore.'",
            "Recovery wasn't linear. There were days when getting out of bed felt like climbing Mount Everest. But slowly, with Dr. Chen's guidance and medication to stabilize her mood, Serena began to rebuild herself from the ground up.",
            "She discovered that vulnerability isn't weakness - sharing her story with other students created connections deeper than any she'd known. Her mental health advocate role at JC became a source of purpose."
        ],
        "climax": "When university application results come in, Serena doesn't get into Medicine. For a moment, the old panic threatens to return. But then she realizes - this isn't the end of her story, it's a new chapter.",
        "resolution": [
            "Serena accepts a place in Psychology at NTU, recognizing her lived experience could help others facing similar struggles.",
            "She maintains her recovery through ongoing therapy, peer support groups, and advocacy work.",
            "Her relationship with her parents has fundamentally changed - they've learned to see mental health as seriously as physical health."
