  "name": "Ling Chen",
  "age": 42,
  "role": "Family - Mother",
  "description": "Serena's mother is a hardworking single parent juggling her accounting job and home responsibilities. As a second-generation Singaporean Chinese woman, she deeply values academic excellence and 'face' in the community. She is well-meaning but emotionally reserved, following traditional Chinese parenting approaches that emphasize discipline, respect, and achievement over emotional expression.",
  
  "relationship_to_serena": "Family - Mother",
  "knowledge_of_mental_health": "Limited understanding; influenced by Chinese cultural stigma that views mental health issues as weakness or moral failure. She believes in 'chi ku' (eating bitterness) and pushing through struggles rather than discussing them openly.",
  "attitude_toward_mental_health": "Initially dismissive and concerned about 'saving face' in the community if Serena seeks help. Views anxiety as a lack of resilience that can be overcome with discipline. She believes Serena just needs to 'toughen up' like she had to do.",
  "impact_on_serena_anxiety": {
    "reduces": ["Rare moments of maternal warmth during Chinese New Year preparations", "When she makes an effort to listen after teacher conferences", "When she shares her own vulnerabilities about migrating to Singapore"],
    "increases": ["When she compares Serena to cousins who excel academically", "When she discusses how much she sacrifices for Serena's education", "When she dismisses anxiety as 'Western concepts'", "During exam periods when she monitors study schedules"]
  },
  "own_mental_health_status": "Mum suffers from undiagnosed depression following her divorce five years ago, which manifests as irritability and emotional withdrawal. She experiences panic attacks late at night but hides them completely, believing they're 'heart problems' rather than anxiety. Her cultural upbringing taught her that seeking mental health support brings shame to the family, so she self-medicates with traditional Chinese medicine and overwork.",
  "communication_style": "Practical, directive, and concerned with 'face' and social standing. Uses Chinese proverbs about perseverance when giving advice. Shows love through acts of service (cooking Serena's favorite dishes) rather than verbal affirmation. Often compares Serena to cousins or classmates as motivation.",
  
  "character_arc": {
    "starting_point": "Dismissive of mental health concerns and focused on academic achievement",
    "middle_development": "Reluctantly attends a parent-teacher conference where Serena's counselor explains anxiety from a biological perspective, causing her to question her assumptions",
    "breakthrough_moment": "Discovers her own mother (Serena's grandmother) secretly took anti-anxiety medication for years, shifting her perspective on family 'weakness'",
    "potential_growth": "Begins to reconcile traditional values with mental health awareness, eventually accompanying Serena to a therapy session and admitting her own struggles"
  },
  
  "background": {
    "childhood": "Grew up in a traditional household where her father was the stern disciplinarian and her mother quietly supported his decisions. Academic achievement was the only measure of worth that received praise.",
    "education": "Graduated from a polytechnic with a diploma in accounting, though she harbored dreams of becoming an architect that were discouraged as impractical.",
    "marriage": "Married at 24 to a successful businessman who became increasingly distant as his career advanced, leading to their divorce when Serena was 12.",
    "career": "Works as a senior accountant at a mid-sized Singaporean firm. Respected for her precision and diligence, but has declined promotions that would require more travel or evening hours to be present for Serena.",
    "support_system": "Limited to a few close friends from her church and her elderly mother who occasionally helps with household duties. Her ex-husband provides financial support but minimal emotional presence in Serena's life."

  "physical_space": {
    "home": "A meticulously maintained 4-room HDB flat in Tampines with traditional Chinese elements mixed with modern furnishings. Family photos are displayed prominently, but only those showing achievements.",
    "serena_study_setup": "Has converted the dining area into an optimized study space for Serena with good lighting, organized shelves, and minimal distractions. Frequently brings tea and brain-healthy snacks without interrupting.",
    "personal_retreat": "Keeps a small altar with family ancestral tablets in her bedroom where she sometimes sits alone late at night, the only space where she allows herself to show emotion.",
    "kitchen": "The heart of the home, always stocked with traditional herbs and ingredients. Cooking is her primary language of love and concern, preparing specific dishes believed to enhance brain function before exams."
