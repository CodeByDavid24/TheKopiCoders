  "role": "Family - Mother",
  "description": "Serena's mother is a hardworking single parent juggling her accounting job and home responsibilities. As a second-generation Singaporean Chinese woman, she deeply values academic excellence and 'face' in the community. She is well-meaning but emotionally reserved, following traditional Chinese parenting approaches that emphasize discipline, respect, and achievement over emotional expression.",
  
  "relationship_to_serena": "Family - Mother",
  "knowledge_of_mental_health": "Limited understanding; influenced by Chinese cultural stigma that views mental health issues as weakness or moral failure. She believes in 'chi ku' (eating bitterness) and pushing through struggles rather than discussing them openly.",
  "attitude_toward_mental_health": "Initially dismissive and concerned about 'saving face' in the community if Serena seeks help. Views anxiety as a lack of resilience that can be overcome with discipline. She believes Serena just needs to 'toughen up' like she had to do.",

  },
  "own_mental_health_status": "Mum suffers from undiagnosed depression following her divorce five years ago, which manifests as irritability and emotional withdrawal. She experiences panic attacks late at night but hides them completely, believing they're 'heart problems' rather than anxiety. Her cultural upbringing taught her that seeking mental health support brings shame to the family, so she self-medicates with traditional Chinese medicine and overwork.",
  "communication_style": "Practical, directive, and concerned with 'face' and social standing. Uses Chinese proverbs about perseverance when giving advice. Shows love through acts of service (cooking Serena's favorite dishes) rather than verbal affirmation. Often compares Serena to cousins or classmates as motivation.",

    "starting_point": "Dismissive of mental health concerns and focused on academic achievement",
    "middle_development": "Reluctantly attends a parent-teacher conference where Serena's counselor explains anxiety from a biological perspective, causing her to question her assumptions",

    "potential_growth": "Begins to reconcile traditional values with mental health awareness, eventually accompanying Serena to a therapy session and admitting her own struggles"

    "growth": [
      "Your Ah Ma also worried too much, like you. Maybe... it runs in the family.",
