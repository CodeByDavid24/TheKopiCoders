# Capstone Project

## Problem Statement:
- Singaporean youths (15-35) not having any knowledge about anxiety.

## Solution:

**An AI interactive fiction that educates Singaporean youths through simulations and scenarios.**
- Interactive Scenarios: Users are guided through situations where they can make choices on how best to help or interact with someone experiencing anxiety, learning effective communication and support strategies in the process.
- Empathy Training: The platform also offers an option to place users in the shoes of someone with anxiety, providing a first-hand perspective on the challenges and emotions associated with the condition.
- By combining engaging storytelling with real-world mental health challenges, our platform promotes awareness, empathy, and actionable skills, empowering youth to support themselves and others effectively.
