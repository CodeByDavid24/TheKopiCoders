# SootheAI: Interactive Mental Health Narrative Application

An AI-powered interactive narrative experience designed to help Singaporean youths understand, manage, and overcome anxiety through engaging storytelling set in culturally relevant contexts.

## About The Project

SootheAI creates an immersive, choice-based narrative that:

- Educates users about anxiety in a relatable context of Singaporean student life
- Presents realistic scenarios based on everyday situations faced by JC students
- Offers meaningful choices that demonstrate different coping strategies
- Provides a safe space to explore mental health challenges through fictional characters

## Features

## Key Components

### 1. Content Safety

SootheAI implements comprehensive content safety measures:

#### Basic Version (main_v0.py)

- Simple blacklist filtering for potentially harmful content
- Safety disclaimers for sensitive discussions
- Redirection to helpline resources when needed
- System prompts designed to avoid explicitly labeling anxiety

#### Enhanced Version (main_v1.py)

- **Multi-tier content filtering** with severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- **Pattern-based detection** using regex for complex harmful content identification
- **Context-aware analysis** for better understanding of user intent
- **Configurable response strategies** based on content severity
- **Comprehensive logging** for monitoring and improvement
- **Dynamic content replacement** with contextually appropriate alternatives

### 2. Character Framework

Characters are defined through detailed JSON files that specify:

- Personality traits and background
- Academic environment and pressures
- Behavioral patterns related to anxiety
- Relationships with family, friends, and teachers
- Coping mechanisms and triggers

### 3. AI Integration

The application integrates with Anthropic's Claude API and ElevenLabs for TTS:

- Generate narrative responses based on user choices using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Text-to-speech conversion for an immersive audio experience
- Maintain conversation history and context
- Filter responses for safety compliance
- Present realistic character behaviors

### 4. Adaptive Ending System (main_v0.py)

- Triggers after 12 user interactions
- Three narrative branches based on user choices:
  - Acknowledgment of feelings and physical symptoms
  - Recognition of late study habits and balance
  - Importance of talking to others and sharing burdens
- Educational summary with key insights about anxiety
- Singapore helpline resources

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. API Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run the Application

For the Streamlit interface:

```bash
streamlit run soothe_interface_dev/stream.py
```

For the Gradio interface (choose version):

```bash
# Simple version with basic filtering and endings
python soothe_app/main_v0.py

# Advanced version with enhanced guardrails
python soothe_app/main_v1.py
```

## Usage

1. When you launch the application, you'll first see a consent message. Type "I agree" to continue.
2. Type "start game" to begin the narrative.
3. Read the story descriptions and make choices to navigate Serena's journey.
4. Type custom responses or select from available options to shape the narrative.
5. Listen to the narration through the text-to-speech feature (if enabled).
6. In main_v0.py, the story will conclude after 12 interactions with an educational summary.

## Testing

Run unit tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s soothe_app/tests
```

For system prompt testing:

```bash
python soothe_app/tests/system_prompt_tester.py --prompt path/to/prompt --consent-flow
```

For enhanced filter integration testing:

```bash
python soothe_app/test_integration.py
```
